Each one of us here today will, at one time in our lives...look upon a loved one who is in need and ask the same question. "We are willing to help, Lord...but what, if anything is needed?"{% 

> For it is true we can seldom help those closet to us.Either we don't know what part of ourselves to give or more often than not,the part we have to give is not wanted.And so it is those we live with and should know who elude us.But we can still love them.We can love completely without complete understanding.

Nothing perfect lasts forever,Except in our memories!

> As a Presbyterian, my father believed that man, by nature, was a damn mess and that only by picking up God's rhythms were we able to regain power and beauty. To him, all good things, trout as well as eternal salvation, come by grace. And grace comes by art, and art does not come easy.
